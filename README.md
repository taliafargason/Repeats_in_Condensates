# Repeats_in_Condensates
Used to identify proteins with a given repetitive sequence and crossmatch with phase separation databases
1) RS_RRM_query_3_8.py identifies all proteins with a given set of dipeptide repeats
2) RS_RRM_size_matched_subsets_5b.py creates a list of 50 randomly selected size-matched subsets to be analyzed by each group using the output from 1)
